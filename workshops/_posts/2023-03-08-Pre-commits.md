## What are pre-commits?

In this knowledge-sharing session, we go through what they are and what they can be used for.
We look at how they can improve our code, and reduce security risks (e.g secretes getting into the repo).
We discuss the individual needs in the projects and common pressure points of our PR review process,
and we looked at how different tools can help us and how we want them to help us.
There was a demo of how it works, and we looked at a Pull Request with a specific configuration for our project.

Important tools in this workshop:
[git client](https://git-scm.com),
[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/),
[Husky.net](https://alirezanet.github.io/Husky.Net/).
