This summer has been used to spend time outside and having fun reading whenever the chance and motivation was up for it.

I managed to get through some books that I enjoyed reading and learning from this summer.

My main focus in reading this summer has to become more profitient with Rust and API Security.
All the books that I read this summer is benefitial for my master thesis as it will be written in Rust as microservices focusing on Security.

Listed in the order I read the books (not rating).
