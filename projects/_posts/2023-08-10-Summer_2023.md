This summer was special, I've never had so many changes in my plans and had to replan my vacation.
Three weeks were intended to spend in the mountains hiking with my dogs and Laura.

Due, to too many injuries and other incidents, our plans were scrapped.
I headed out to follow a long-missed dream, running cabin to cabin in the Norwegian mountains.
Packed with books, I started out running [Finse to Haukeliseter](https://ut.no/turforslag/112436/signatur-massiv-4-etappe-hardangervidda).

After a few days of running, eating, reading and enjoying the mountains, I finished and was hungry for more.
Convincing Laura wasn't hard, she ran the support team, shuttling around supplies for me to eat between the cabins and giving the dogs an adventure.
With this support, I was able to finish running 365km in the mountains from [Sota SÃ¦ter to Haukeliseter](https://ut.no/turforslag/1115677/signatur-massiv-langrute-fra-sota-ster-til-haukeliseter)

Besides running, I also got to read in the evening and there were a few good reads this summer also.

Listed in the order I read the books (no rating).
