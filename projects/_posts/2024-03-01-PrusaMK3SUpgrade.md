This year, I decided to get a 3D printer. I was using the 3D-printer we have at work often and I was using it too support my van conversion.
I found that I was restricted by print times at work (we could only print when at work), and decided that the feedback loop of uncertain models would be faster if I had one next to me.

So, I used Finn.no to find a used one, and I found this Prusa MK3S+ that was malfunctioning and repaired it.

The previous owner said it failed prints half-way through and they could not figure out anything that was wrong.

After a few failed prints, and a week of diagnostics, I found a poorly connected wire to the extruder fan and soldered it. After that the printer printed perfectly, after the other tuning errors was corrected.

After this, and quite some use, I decided to upgrade the printer to MK4.
This improved the print times and quality significantly.
