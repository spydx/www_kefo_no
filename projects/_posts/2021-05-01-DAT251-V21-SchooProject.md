## Lopelassen

[Webpage: Lopeplassen](https://lopeplassen.vercel.app/)
[Backend: Swagger](https://lop-backend.herokuapp.com)

TL;DR; It is a [Finn.no](https://www.finn.no) for running/trailrunning competitions.

Idea is to have a improve on todays platforms to create a better solution
that captures the goals:

* Make it easier to find and participate in local runs
* Make it easier to reach out to potential runners

This project was mainly to focus on studying SCRUM, XP and other Agile techniques for managing a project.
