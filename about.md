{% avatar {{ site.github_username }} size=150 %}

Fun-loving guy who has a passion for secure coding, dogs, and the outdoors.

You'll either find me running around on some mountain with my dog or benched behind the computer screen until the late nights.

Masters in Software Engineering with a focus on security at the University in Bergen.

My paper is about Capability-based Security in distributed systems.
