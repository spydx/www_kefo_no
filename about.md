{% avatar {{ site.github_username }} size=150 %}

Fun-loving guy who has a passion for secure coding, dogs, and the outdoors.

You'll either find me running around on some mountain with my dogs or benched behind the computer screen until late at night.

Master in Software Engineering with a focus on security at the University in Bergen.

My paper is about Capability-based Security in distributed systems.

Do not hesitate to contact me
