Fun loving guy, having a passion for secure coding, dogs and the outdoors.

You'll either find me running around on some mountain with my dog or benched behind the computerscreen until the late nights.

Currently doing my masters in Software Engineering at the University in Bergen.

My paper is about Security Microservice architecture.

Do not hesitate to contact me
